# Example of use

## Writing code

* [Analyze a water temperature time series from a netCDF file.](https://github.com/rbardaji/oceanobs/blob/master/docs/examples/temp_netcdf.md)
* [Quality Control Flag generation in temperature time series from a pickle file.](https://github.com/rbardaji/oceanobs/blob/master/docs/examples/qc_temp_pickle.md)
* [Point on a map the position of a marine observatory.](https://github.com/rbardaji/oceanobs/blob/master/docs/examples/point_map.md)
* [Compare sea water temperature measurements of two sensors in the same marine observatory.](https://github.com/rbardaji/oceanobs/blob/master/docs/examples/temp_comparison.md)

## Using MOODA app

* [Analyze a water temperature time series from a netCDF file with MOODA.](https://github.com/rbardaji/oceanobs/blob/master/docs/examples/temp_pickle_mooda.md)
* [Quality Control Flag generation in temperature time series from a pickle file with MOODA.](https://github.com/rbardaji/oceanobs/blob/master/docs/examples/qc_temp_pickle_mooda.md)
* [Compare sea water temperature measurements of two sensors in the same EGIM with MOODA.] -> Work in progress
