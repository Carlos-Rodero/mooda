New Features
  In gui.py: Now we can open EMODnet files.
  In observatory.py:
    - plt_atmpres(): Plot pressure at sea level in dBs.
    - plt_atmpres(): Plot sea level in meters.
    - plt_prec(): Plot rain accumulation in millimeters.
    - plt_relhu(): Plot relative humidity in %.
    - plt_gusp(): Plot gust wind speed in meter/second.

Performance Enhancements
  In emodnet.py:
    - open(): 1) Fixed a bug opening a list of file paths. 2) We removed the option to open CSV files. It is very difficult to understand the columns of the CSV file.
  In gui.py: Fixed bug opening the GUI with an external call.
  In observatory.py:
    - plt_atm(): x1000 is deleted.
